This is a personal project to study the accuracy of the Australian Burea of Meteorology's 7 day forecast data.
This project will be studying metrics such as the difference between predictions and actual weather data as reported on the day by the BOM.
The project is not meant in any way to influence perception of the Bureau's data. This would be well outside the scope of this project.
The only purpose is to allow me to personally assess the forecast data to see how much I can rely on it as an advance prediction.

Having made this disclaimer, the intent of this project is to keep a daily record of the data for my local weather station, provided through the BOM's anonymous public API. I will be using Python to perform comparisons to show the change over 7 days of predictions of temperature, rainfull and chance of precipitation.
