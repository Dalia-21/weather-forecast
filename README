This is a personal project to study the accuracy of the Australian Burea of Meteorology's 7 day forecast data.
This project will be studying metrics such as the difference between predictions and actual weather data as reported on the day by the BOM.
The purpose of the project is to allow me to personally assess the forecast data to see how much I can rely on it as an advance prediction.
While others can clone this code and perform their own studies, the intent of this project is solely for personal use.

Having made this disclaimer, the intent of this project is to keep a daily record of the data for my local weather station, provided through the BOM's anonymous public API. I will be using Python to perform comparisons to show the change over 7 days of predictions of temperature, rainfull and chance of precipitation.

Due to copyright restrictions on BOM data, the results will only be viewable by me through an authenticated web interface. In order to see similar results, others will need to replicate this study themselves.
